# ☔ The Ghiblidex

This is [the Ghiblidex](https://beansebrrr.github.io/Ghiblidex/index.html), a little index of all the Studio Ghibli movies I’ve watched. This is a response to the fact that I have never watched movies from Ghibli *in full* until now and by the end of this little project, I should find myself a little bit more knowledgeable in the worlds built by this one studio.

## 🗣️ “Okay so what is it really for”

Okay okay, you got me. I’m making this for CS50x 2024’s Project Set 8 - Homepage. Yeah. That’s basically it. But also, I really did want to watch more Ghibli films.
